Create a Simple React Native Application

1. The app should display the OurPath logo at the top (any logo of ours is fine, but it is up to the candidate to find one)
2. The app should have text underneath the logo reading 'Hello, my name is '
3. The app should have a text input underneath the 'Hello, my name is ' which when text is entered, appends text to the end of 'Hello, my name is '.

IOS

A README.md is optional.

Test are optional, but recommended.

We recommend setting up eslint for the project (including an .eslintrc file). The styling rules are up to you - but Airbnb's rules are a good place to start.
